This folder can be used to store static documents, such as HTML pages, CSS files and JS code. LODSPeaKr doesn't force you to use it, however, it is considered a good practice to have everything under static/ and not disperse everywhere.

A second benefit is that it will allow other people to reuse your static pages if you decide to export the code. LODSPeaKr will only look on static/ models/ and views/ directories.
